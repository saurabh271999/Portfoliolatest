        Here are some of the projects I've worked on, each built from scratch to solve real-world problems and demonstrate my skills across the full development stack.
        These projects reflect not just my technical knowledge, but also my passion for coding, designing scalable systems, and building user-friendly applications.
        From frontend design to backend logic and database integration â€” every project showcases my journey as a full-stack web developer.
